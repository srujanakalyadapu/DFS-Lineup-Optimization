# DFS-Lineup-Optimization
This study leverages advanced analytics and optimization techniques to tackle the challenge of constructing high-performance NBA fantasy lineups. By integrating machine learning, integer programming, dynamic programming, and network graph analysis, the project aims to develop a robust system for lineup construction and analysis. It navigates through the complex dynamics of player performance, game conditions, and strategic diversification to optimize fantasy sports outcomes.

## Business Problem
The primary business challenge addressed in this study is the optimal construction of NBA fantasy sports lineups under stringent constraints (like salary caps and player positions), while ensuring minimal overlap among lineups. This is crucial for success in daily fantasy sports, where the ability to navigate through and optimize based on numerous variables can significantly influence outcomes in fantasy sports contests.

## Methodology
The methodology unfolds in four interconnected stages, enhancing decision-making in fantasy sports:
* Player Daily Fantasy Point Projections: Utilizes historical player statistics and opponent teamâ€™s defensive metrics to forecast player performance using machine learning algorithms.
* Optimization Modeling: Employs integer programming to generate 100 unique fantasy lineups with the Python PuLP package, ensuring diversity through an innovative overlap constraint.
* Dynamic Programming: Refines the selection process to pick optimal lineups from the generated pool, minimizing overlap and maximizing potential performance.
* Network Graphs: Integrates PageRank algorithm to analyze player importance across lineups, providing insights into strategic player selection and lineup stability.
  
## Results and Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of complex analytical techniques to the realm of NBA fantasy sports, achieving several key outcomes:
* Enhanced Prediction System: Developed a machine learning-based system that accurately predicts player performances, forming the backbone of the lineup optimization process.
* Optimized Lineup Construction: Through integer programming, the project efficiently handled the constraints of fantasy sports competitions, such as budget and player positions, while ensuring strategic diversity in lineup creation.
* Strategic Lineup Selection: Employed a dynamic programming approach to select lineups strategically from a larger pool, effectively minimizing overlap and managing risk.
* Graph-Based Player Analysis: Utilized network graphs and the PageRank algorithm to identify key players critical to multiple lineups, adding a layer of strategic depth to lineup selections.
* Future Directions: Suggests potential enhancements like real-time data integration and more sophisticated machine learning models to further refine lineup predictions and decisions.
